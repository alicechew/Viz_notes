# Chapter 4 Setup
**Set up Python web server**
In project folder, via command line:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &
```

This will work with Python version 2.x, but in Python versions 3.0 and newer, SimpleHTTPServer has been removed. For Python 3.x, just replace SimpleHTTPServer with http.server in the command.
